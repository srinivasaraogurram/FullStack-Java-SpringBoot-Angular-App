### **1. Application Overview**

This is a comprehensive, multi-stack to-do application. It's designed not only as a functional application but also as a **learning and development toolkit**, demonstrating best practices across a full-stack environment. It includes multiple front-end and back-end options, extensive documentation, testing, CI/CD, and containerization.

### **2. User Roles & Functionality**

The application will have two primary roles: **User** and **Admin**. Upon login, a user will be prompted to select their desired role for the session.

* **Standard User Role:**
    * **Authentication & Profile:** Sign-up, Login/Logout, Profile Update, and Password Change.
    * **To-Do Management:** CRUD operations for **Topics** (containers for tasks) and **Tasks** (to-do items) within each topic.
* **Admin Role:**
    * **User Management:** View all users, activate/deactivate accounts, and update user profiles on their behalf.

### **3. Technical Stack**

This project will showcase a polyglot approach with multiple front-end and back-end technologies.

* **Front-End:**
    * **Angular 18:** A structured, opinionated framework.
    * **React 18:** A flexible, library-based framework.
* **Back-End:**
    * **Java 21 with Spring Boot 3.6:** A robust framework for enterprise-grade applications. Uses Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
    * **Express.js:** A minimalist Node.js framework for building REST APIs.
* **Database:**
    * **JSON Server:** Used for local development and prototyping. The `db.json` file will serve as the mock database.
* **Testing:**
    * **Unit Tests:** Jest (for React), Karma/Jasmine (for Angular), JUnit (for Spring Boot), and Mocha/Chai (for Express.js).
    * **Integration/Functional Tests:** Cypress and Cucumber.
* **DevOps & Deployment:**
    * **CI/CD:** Scripts for GitLab, GitHub Actions, and Jenkins.
    * **Containerization:** Docker.
    * **IaC (Infrastructure as Code):** Terraform for AWS, Azure, and GCP.
    * **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKS) with auto-scaling.
* **Monitoring:**
    * **ELK Stack:** Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana for centralized logging and dashboarding.
* **Load Testing:**
    * **LoadRunner:** Scripts to test auto-scaling functionality.

### **5. Key Features & Best Practices**

* **Comprehensive Documentation:** Each technology stack has dedicated documentation explaining its concepts, application flow, and execution.
* **Microservices-oriented APIs:** The back-end APIs will be built as independent services, making the application scalable.
* **API Testing:** Dedicated folders for Postman and cURL scripts with sample data ensure easy and thorough API testing.
* **Automated Testing:** Unit and integration tests are a core part of the development process to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. Code coverage reports will be generated.
* **Automated Deployment (CI/CD):** CI/CD pipelines automate the build, test, and deployment process, enabling a fast and reliable release cycle.
* **Containerization:** Using Docker ensures the application and its dependencies are packaged consistently across all environments.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform scripts enable automated provisioning and management of cloud resources, ensuring reproducibility and version control of infrastructure.
* **Auto-scaling:** The application will be deployed on Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKS) with horizontal pod auto-scaling (HPA) enabled to handle varying loads. LoadRunner scripts will be provided to simulate traffic and test this functionality.
* **Monitoring & Logging:** The ELK stack will be used to centralize logs and metrics, providing insights into application performance and health through custom dashboards. 
* **Interview-Ready Content:** A dedicated `interview-questions` folder provides a valuable resource for developers to learn and prepare for technical interviews on each included technology, complete with Q&A and code examples.

### **6. Development & Deployment Workflow**

1.  **Start DB:** Use `scripts/start-db.sh` to launch the JSON Server.
2.  **Start Back-end:** Run the Spring Boot or Express.js application.
3.  **Start Front-end:** Choose either the Angular or React application to run.
4.  **Local Testing:** Use Postman or cURL scripts to test API endpoints.
5.  **Run Tests:** Execute unit and integration tests to ensure functionality.
6.  **CI/CD:** Push code to Git. The respective CI/CD pipeline (GitLab/GitHub/Jenkins) will trigger, running tests and building Docker images.
7.  **Container Deployment:** Terraform scripts will provision the cloud infrastructure (EKS, AKS, or GKS), and the CI/CD pipeline will deploy the Dockerized application to the Kubernetes cluster.
8.  **Monitoring:** Access the Kibana dashboard to view application logs, metrics, and monitor performance.
9.  **Load Testing:** Use LoadRunner scripts to generate traffic and observe auto-scaling behavior on the Kubernetes cluster.
