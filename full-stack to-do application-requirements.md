Your description provides a solid foundation for a full-stack to-do application. I've refined and organized the content to be a clearer, more structured blueprint for development. I've also added some best-practice suggestions to make your plan more robust.

### **1. Application Overview**

This is a full-stack to-do application designed to help users manage their tasks. The application supports multiple user roles, with distinct functionalities for a standard **user** and an **admin**.

---

### **2. User Roles & Functionality**

The application will have two primary roles: **User** and **Admin**. Upon login, a user will be prompted to select their desired role for the session.

#### **Standard User Role**

* **Authentication & Profile:**
    * **Sign-Up:** New users can create an account.
    * **Login/Logout:** Secure access to the application.
    * **Profile Management:** Update personal information and change their password.
* **To-Do Management:**
    * **Topics:** Users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) multiple topics. Each topic acts as a container for a to-do list.
    * **Tasks:** Within each topic, users can perform CRUD operations on individual tasks. This forms the core to-do list functionality.

#### **Admin Role**

* **User Management:**
    * **User List:** View a list of all users.
    * **Account Status:** Activate or deactivate user accounts.
    * **Profile Updates:** Edit user profiles on behalf of the user.

### **3. Technical Stack**

The application will use a modern, robust tech stack to ensure scalability and maintainability.

* **Front-End:** **Angular 18 (LTS)**
    * A component-based framework for building a dynamic, single-page application (SPA).
* **Back-End:** **Java 21 with Spring Boot 3.6**
    * Provides RESTful APIs to handle all business logic and data persistence.
    * **Spring Security:** Will be used to manage authentication and authorization based on the user's role.
* **Database:** **JSON Server**
    * For development and prototyping, a JSON server will be used as a mock database.
    * Data will be stored in a collection of `.json` files. 

---

### **4. Data Model & Relationships**

The data will be organized into a relational structure, despite using JSON files.

* **User:**
    * Represents a registered user.
    * Has a one-to-one relationship with a single login.
* **Topic:**
    * A user can have multiple topics. This is a **one-to-many** relationship (one user to many topics).
    * Users can perform CRUD operations on their topics.
* **Task:**
    * A topic can have multiple tasks. This is a **one-to-many** relationship (one topic to many tasks).
    * Users can perform CRUD operations on tasks within a specific topic.

This structure allows for a clear, logical organization of data, ensuring that tasks are always associated with a topic and topics are always associated with a user.

---

### **5. Project Structure**

A clean folder structure will be used to keep the project organized.

* **`my-todo-app/`**
    * **`frontend/`**
        * Contains the Angular 18 application code.
    * **`backend/`**
        * Contains the Java Spring Boot application code.
    * **`database/`**
        * **`db.json`:** The single JSON file for JSON Server.
            * **`seed-data/`:** Initial data for starting the application (e.g., a few users, topics, and tasks).
            * **`transactional-data/`:** Data created by users during application usage. (Note: These could be managed within a single `db.json` file for simplicity with JSON Server).
    * **`scripts/`**
        * **`start-db.sh`:** A script to start the JSON Server.
        * **`stop-db.sh`:** A script to stop the JSON Server.
