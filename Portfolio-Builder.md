This is an excellent and ambitious project. Here's a refined plan for a generic, multi-tenant portfolio website that can be used by various professionals, with a focus on a robust, multi-role content management system.

### **1. Application Overview**

This is a multi-tenant, multi-role portfolio website application. It provides a generic, configurable template that can be used by developers, QA engineers, architects, and project managers to showcase their work. The application has two primary modes: a public-facing view and a private, secure content management system (CMS) for logged-in users.

---

### **2. User Roles & Functionality**

The application will support a multi-role structure with specific permissions for each role.

* **Public (Unauthenticated) User:**
    * Can view published portfolios by navigating to a unique, public URL.
    * Cannot log in, create, or modify content.

* **Standard User Role (Authenticated):**
    * **Sign-Up/Login:** Create an account to get started.
    * **Portfolio Management:**
        * View their own portfolio pages.
        * Modify content on their respective portfolio pages.
        * **Publish:** Generate a unique, public URL for their portfolio.
    * **Profile Management:** Update personal information and change passwords.

* **Admin Role (Authenticated):**
    * **All User Permissions:** Inherits all functionalities of a standard user.
    * **Page Creation:** Add new, custom pages to their portfolio with placeholder content. This is a key feature, as it allows users to extend their portfolio beyond the default template.
    * **Content Management:** Modify the content of the new pages they've created.

### **3. Technical Stack & Data Model**

The technical stack is chosen for scalability and performance, supporting a multi-tenant architecture.

* **Front-End:** **Angular 18 & React 18**. The folder structure will support both frameworks, allowing for comparison and choice.
* **Back-End:**
    * **Java 21 with Spring Boot 3.6 & Spring Security:** Handles authentication, authorization, and the RESTful APIs.
    * **Express.js:** A alternative backend option for a more lightweight stack.
* **Database:** **MongoDB**
    * A NoSQL document database, ideal for storing the flexible, page-based content of the portfolios.
    * **Indexing:** Indexes will be created on fields like `userId` and `pageId` to ensure fast content retrieval.

#### **Data Model & Relationships**

This application requires a **multi-tenant** data model where a single instance of the application serves multiple users, keeping their data logically separated.

* **User Document:**
    * Stores user credentials, roles (`user`, `admin`), and profile information.
    * `_id`: Unique user identifier.
    * `username`, `password`, `email`, `roles`.

* **Portfolio Document (Multi-tenant Structure):**
    * Each user's entire portfolio content (all pages and their content) can be stored as a single document in a `portfolios` collection. This is a common pattern for multi-tenant applications using MongoDB.
    * `_id`: Unique portfolio ID.
    * `userId`: **(Indexed)** The ID of the user this portfolio belongs to.
    * `pages`: An array of embedded documents.
        * `pageId`: **(Indexed)** Unique ID for each page.
        * `title`: "About Me", "Projects", "Experience", etc.
        * `content`: The actual text, images, and other components of the page.
        * `isPublished`: Boolean flag to control public visibility.

### **4. Best Practices**

* **Authentication & Authorization:**
    * Use **Spring Security** (or a similar library in Express.js) with **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)** for secure, stateless authentication.
    * Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** to ensure that a "user" cannot access admin-only functions, and a user can only edit their own content.

* **Scalability & Performance:**
    * **Efficient Queries:** MongoDB indexes on `userId` and `pageId` will significantly improve query performance, especially as the number of users grows.
    * **CDN for Assets:** Static assets like images and videos should be served from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to reduce latency and server load.
    * **Lazy Loading:** In the front-end, use lazy loading for images and non-critical components to improve initial page load times.

* **User Experience (UX):**
    * **What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) Editor:** Implement a rich-text editor in the admin section so users can easily format and style their content without needing to write code.
    * **Unique Public URL:** Generate a clean, SEO-friendly URL (e.g., `portfolio.com/johndoe`) for each published portfolio.

### **5. Project Structure & Workflow**

The project structure will be similar to the previous plan but with a specific focus on the multi-tenant architecture and MongoDB.

* **Directory Structure:**
    * `my-portfolio-app/`
        * `frontend/` (Angular 18 & React 18)
        * `backend/` (Spring Boot & Express.js)
        * `database/` (Scripts for MongoDB setup and indexing)
        * `docs/` (Application flow, deployment guide, etc.)
        * `postman-scripts/`
        * `cicd/`
        * `infrastructure/`
        * `...` (Other folders from the previous plan)
* **Workflow:**
    1.  **User Sign-Up:** A new user registers and their account is created in the database with the `user` role.
    2.  **Portfolio Creation:** Upon successful login, a placeholder portfolio document is created for the user.
    3.  **Content Modification:** The user can log in and use the admin dashboard to add/edit content on their portfolio pages.
    4.  **Publishing:** When ready, the user clicks "Publish," and a unique URL is generated for their portfolio. The `isPublished` flag is set to `true`.
    5.  **Public Viewing:** Anyone can now access the portfolio via the unique URL.
    6.  **Admin Features:** A user with the `admin` role can log in and see an option to "Add New Page," which creates a new embedded page document within their portfolio document. .
